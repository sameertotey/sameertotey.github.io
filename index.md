## Welcome to my HomePage

I am a software developer looking to getting back to writing quality software applications.  

Recently I explored  currently updating my web development skills.  So far the platforms explored for web development projects include:
* Ruby on Rails
* Node.js
* jQuery
* Angular.js
* Backbone.js

I particularly like the full support provided by Ruby on Rails. I also like simplicity and flexibility of Node.js and have learned to love Javascript as I learned jQuery and Backbone.js.  

I am currently working on exploring Angular.js

This page is still under construction!
