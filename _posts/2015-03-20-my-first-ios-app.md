title: My First iOS App on the App Store
---

I am very excited to report that my very first iOS app is now available on the [App Store]( https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blackjack-configurable/id975037070?ls=1&mt=8). 

<p class="message">
Please use the game and review it on the App Store.

# [Blackjack-Configurable]( https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blackjack-configurable/id975037070?ls=1&mt=8)

It's a iOS app written in Swift. All graphics and animation for the game was done using the iOS UIKit framework. The game is integrated with [Apple's game center](https://developer.apple.com/game-center/).

It is a [Blackjack card game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) with configurable rules. You can practice blackjack strategy by easily setting rules applicable to any blackjack establishment. Plenty of configuration options are available.  

## Open Source

The app is completely free and open source.  You can check the [Github repo](https://github.com/sameertotey/BlackJack) to view all the source code. 

### Configuration options
I have spend great effort to ensure that all the Blackjack game rules are applied accurately. Since there are so many variations of the Blackjack game, I have created easy configuration settings to set the desired rules.

### Future plans

I plan to add more features to this game in the future releases, please stay tuned for updates. In the meanwhile visit the app's [support site](http://www.sameertotey.com/BlackJack/) to learn how to play the game.
